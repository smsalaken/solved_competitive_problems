Highest Cost Orders


Find the customer with the highest daily total order cost between 2019-02-01 to 2019-05-01. If customer had more than one order on a certain day, sum the order costs on daily basis. Output customer's first name, total cost of their items, and the date.
 
 For simplicity, you can assume that every first name in the dataset is unique.

questions I should ask / should have asked:
	are the first names unique? (completely missed this before reading the last line of the question)
	do they want one customer per day or just one customer across all day?
	what happens if there are multiple customers with the highest total order value? Do I return all of them?
