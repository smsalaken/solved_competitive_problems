Acceptance Rate By Date
What is the overall friend acceptance rate by date? Your output should have the rate of acceptances by the date the request was sent. Order by the earliest date to latest.

Assume that each friend request starts by a user sending (i.e., user_id_sender) a friend request to another user (i.e., user_id_receiver) that's logged in the table with action = 'sent'. If the request is accepted, the table logs action = 'accepted'. If the request is not accepted, no record of action = 'accepted' is logged.

table:
	fb_friend_requests

	user_id_sender		varchar
	user_id_receiver	varchar
	date 				datetime
	action 				varchar

	select 
	    date,
	    1.0 * count(accepted)/count(*) as percentage_acceptance
	from (
	select 
	    a.date,
	    a.user_id_sender,
	    a.user_id_receiver,
	    a.action as first_action,
	    b.action as accepted
	from fb_friend_requests a
	left join (
	    select 
	        user_id_sender,
	        user_id_receiver,
	        action,
	        date as accepted_date
	    from fb_friend_requests
	    where action = 'accepted'
	    
	) b
	    on a.user_id_sender = b.user_id_sender and a.user_id_receiver = b.user_id_receiver
	where a.action = 'sent'
	) summary
	group by date
	order by date asc;

	# Import your libraries
	import pandas as pd

	# Start writing code
	fb_friend_requests.head()

	sent = fb_friend_requests.loc[fb_friend_requests['action'] == 'sent']

	accepted = fb_friend_requests.loc[fb_friend_requests['action'] == 'accepted']
	accepted.columns = ['user_id_sender', 'user_id_receiver', 'acceptance_date', 'acceptance_status']


	combined = sent.merge(accepted, how = 'left', on = ['user_id_sender', 'user_id_receiver'])

	r = combined.groupby(['date']).agg({'action' : lambda x: sum(x =='sent'), 'acceptance_status' : lambda x: sum(x == 'accepted')})

	r['percentage_acceptance'] = r['acceptance_status']/r['action']

	r.reset_index(inplace = True)

	r[['date', 'percentage_acceptance']]
