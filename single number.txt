Singel number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

****  solution
******************

O(n) solutiion, and pretty bad as I had to use two for loops (although not nested):


class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        elems = {}
        for i in nums:
            if i in elems.keys():
                elems[i] += 1
            else:
                elems[i] = 1
                
                
        matched = [key for key,value in elems.items() if value == 1]
        
        return matched[0]
